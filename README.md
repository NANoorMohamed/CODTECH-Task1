### Project: Password Strength Checker

### Objective
Create a tool that assesses the strength of user-entered passwords based on various criteria such as length, complexity, and uniqueness. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you build the password strength checker

### Key Activities
**Length:** Passwords should be at least 8 characters, with a preference for longer passwords.

**Complexity:** The password should contain a mix of:

    Uppercase letters (A-Z)
    Lowercase letters (a-z)
    Numbers (0-9)
    Special characters (e.g., !, @, #, $)

**Uniqueness:** Avoid common passwords, dictionary words, or repetitive patterns (e.g., “password123”, “abcd1234”).

### Technologies Used
Python is a popular choice for building a password strength checker because it has libraries for handling string operations, pattern matching, and regex.
It also uses the HaveIBeenPwned API to find if the entered password has been already breached.
